Nates Work
===============

* worked through this material in python and c up to section 3:  http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html

* worked to comment my programs properly and set up a function that generated random arrays with a given size, ran the sort function a set number of times and outputted the time each function call took to a text file.

* some useful googling answers I found include:

* had trouble taking user inputs to determine size and number of times to run - tried scanf but only got the binary output of the pointer, or 1.  Uncertain how to set the variable correctly to an int - best answers I could find involved taking the input as a string and converting it with a for loop - didnt implement.
